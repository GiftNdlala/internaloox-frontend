|---|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | BUG-001 | FRONTEND ISSUE - When creating a new order, the create new order button requires the "Products in Order" Form to be filled in. | CREATE ORDER button should create an order without the "Products in Order" form filled in, as long as the product table inside the Create New Order Form to have atleast one product added | create new order button requires the "Products in Order" button to be filled in before creating any order which is pointless since there is a Add product that adds and stores orders to the table | When creating a new order, the create new order button requires the "Products in Order" button to be filled in which is pointless since there is a Add product that adds and stores orders to the table. so the button shouln't dependant on the filled in add product form but should depend on the product table inside the product form to have atleast one product added | ✅ **FIXED** - Updated validation logic in OrderForm.js to check orderItems table instead of form fields |

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- **File Modified:** `frontend/src/components/OrderForm.js`
- **Validation Logic:** Changed from checking form fields to checking `orderItems.length > 0`
- **Code Reference:** Line 154: `if (orderItems.length === 0) { setErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, orderItems: 'Add at least one product' })); return; }`
- **Frontend API:** Uses `createOrder` endpoint from `api.js`
- **Backend Endpoint:** `POST /api/orders/` - OrderViewSet.create() method

- **Permissions:** Owner, Admin, Warehouse, Warehouse_Worker roles
- **Automatic Transitions:** 
  - `completed` → `order_ready` + sets expected delivery date
  - `ready_for_delivery` → `order_ready`
- **History Tracking:** Creates OrderHistory entries for audit trail
- **Frontend API:** `updateProductionStatus()` function in `api.js` line 163
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Production status updates now trigger proper order workflow transitions
